Description: 64-bit thunk generator for 16- and 32-bit code
 thunk-gen is a thunk generator for C and assembler code, providing
 wrappers so that code written for 16- or 32-bit environments can be
 compiled for 64-bit environments.
 .
 It is intended for use with 64-bit DOS-style environments running
 code intended for 16- or 32-bit DOS, typically dosemu2.
